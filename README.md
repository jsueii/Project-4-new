# Ingredients 
* lb sliced bacon
* 2cups Original Bisquick™ Mix
* 1cup milk
* 6eggs
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Real maple or maple-flavored syrup

# Steps
1. Cut bacon slices into 1/2-inch pieces. Cook in skillet or microwave until desired crispness is reached.
2. Meanwhile, heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat or electric griddle to 375°F; grease with cooking spray, vegetable oil or shortening. (Surface is ready when a few drops of water sprinkled on it dance and disappear.)
3. In medium bowl, stir together Bisquick® mix, milk and 2 of the eggs until well blended. Stir three-fourths of the cooked bacon into batter.
4. For each pancake, pour about 1/3 cup batter onto hot griddle. Cook until bubbles break on surface and edges just begin to dry. Turn; cook until golden brown.
5. While pancakes are cooking, in 8- to 10-inch skillet, cook remaining 4 eggs and remaining one-fourth of the cooked bacon over medium heat until scrambled. Add salt and pepper to taste.
6. Remove pancakes from griddle. Using biscuit cutter or round cookie cutter, cut a circle in center of every other pancake. Stack cut pancake over whole pancake on serving plate. Fill hole with eggs and bacon. Serve warm with syrup.

# Expert tips
* After bacon is cooked, remove extra grease by placing the bacon on a paper towel-covered plate and pressing the top of the bacon with another paper towel.
* For extra-delicious eggs, add a couple tablespoons of bacon grease to the eggs before scrambling.
