      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut bacon slices into 1/2-inch pieces. Cook in skillet or microwave until desired crispness is reached.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat or electric griddle to 375°F; grease with cooking spray,
          vegetable oil or shortening. (Surface is ready when a few drops of water sprinkled on it dance and disappear.)</li>
        <li>In medium bowl, stir together Bisquick® mix, milk and 2 of the eggs until well blended. Stir three-fourths of the cooked bacon into batter.</li>
        <li>For each pancake, pour about 1/3 cup batter onto hot griddle. Cook until bubbles break on surface and edges just begin to dry. Turn; cook until golden brown.</li>
        <li>While pancakes are cooking, in 8- to 10-inch skillet, cook remaining 4 eggs and remaining one-fourth of the cooked bacon over medium heat until scrambled. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Remove pancakes from griddle. Using biscuit cutter or round cookie cutter, cut a circle in center of every other pancake. Stack cut pancake over whole pancake on serving plate. Fill hole with eggs and bacon. Serve warm with syrup.</li>

      </ol>

      <h2>Expert tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After bacon is cooked, remove extra grease by placing the bacon on a paper towel-covered plate and pressing the top of the bacon with another paper towel.</li>
        <li>For extra-delicious eggs, add a couple tablespoons of bacon grease to the eggs before scrambling.</li>
